------------------------------------ JDG Shell Testing ------------------------------------

For testing the shell program, I tested both the interactive and batch modes quite
extensively. This way I could ensure that both modes would produce the same 
desired output. I also frequentley checked the output from the bash shell with the same 
commands I was using, to make sure myshell was producing the same output. This was a huge
help as I could easily test to make sure all commands worked properly. I also made sure
the program would not crash, by throwing intentionally invalid commands at it. I also
used a lot of whitespaces in between the commands to make sure the shell could handle it.
There are also screenshots in the github repo that shows the various tests. The shell is 
very solid and can handle quite a lot. There are few minor issues, like running external 
commands with flags in parrallel will ignore the flags. This is due to the way the
external command handler is written and would need a fair amount of changes. 
The shell has no problem running mulitiple built in commands with flags in parrallel, and
overall is a very sturdy application.
